_Disclaimer_: the original author of this app, Matthew Trullinger AKA ridiculousx, stopped supporting it. He originally made it for himself, so releasing it to the public was an act of goodwill. I, as the mantainer of this repository, and with the approval of the original author, am making this app available as an open source project under the GPL licence, in the hope that more developers can contribute and improve on it.

About the proximity layout:
Designed for efficient single finger typing and better utilization of screen space in portrait orientation. Vowels are grouped in the middle. Letters that commonly appear next to each other in words ("th", "ch", "sh", "ly", "ck", "es", "ing", etc.) are adjacent to each other on the keyboard.
